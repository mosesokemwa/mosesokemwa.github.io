Once in a lifetime you come across a job description that matches your skills and experience. This is one of those moments.


A bit about me
```md
I have been working as a Software Developer for the past 6+ years.
I have experience in developing software applications, web applications, and APIs.
Worked with a variety of technologies including Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL.
I have a deep understanding of with code management and development processes.

I am familiar with several languages and fluent in Python.
All this experience comes from working on discreet,
at times ambiguous challenges harnessing my ability to find unusual solutions to technical problems. The list of challenging work is rather long, ranging from Investment management products ro DevOps migration(Google Cloud/DigitalOcean to AWS).
```

With this kind of experience, how do you go about putting it to good use? The answer is simple, find a role that matches your skills and experience. They are few and far between, but when you find one, it's worth pursuing.


I sent my application for the role of Senior Developer, and now we wait for the response. Fingers crossed!


The description of the role
```md
Senior Developer
We're seeking an experienced developer with a proven ability to find unusual solutions to technical problems.

ABOUT THE ROLE
Our senior developers work on ***** by turning product decisions into technical designs, and then into code. Alongside the existing senior developers, you'll share responsibility for setting technical standards and designs.

Our ******** are appliances (hardware and virtual) with a stack that starts with Linux kernel modifications and ends in CSS, touching network code, service daemons in Python and C, more DNS than you can imagine, Flask, and the HTML/JS/CSS combo along the way. The management consoles have their own stack, and bring different challenges in terms of scale. We have custom network protocols and more. A great candidate might not know each of these levels, but isn't scared to learn.

LOCATION
Remote OR Hybrid

KEY SKILLS
We're primarily looking for flexibility and ingenuity. A developer who isn't too encumbered by strata. You'll be able to point to examples of challenges you've tackled in unexpected ways.

You'll notice we don't specify a language here, and that's because the right candidate will be familiar with several languages, and fluent in at least one. Python experience is beneficial, but we've been making increasing forays into Go.

Experience with code management, and development processes.

CONTACT
If shipping hardware, patching kernels, building DNS channels, or writing honeypots sounds like your cup of tea, get in touch.
