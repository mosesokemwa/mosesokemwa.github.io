### **Software Developer and Engineer career stages**
The stages are:

- Coder
- Junior Developer
- Intermediate Developer
- Senior Developer
- Lead Developer
- Tech Leader

These stages are not job titles. They represent a developer's real experience and competence.

It's been said that someone with 10 years experience might, in practice, have repeated the same 1 year of experience over-and-over!

Let's take a look at these stages to get an idea of where you fit and where you might want to go in the future.

##### **Coder**
A coder is a hobbyist.

If you don't get paid professionally or work with a team of other developers, then you might be a coder.

##### **Junior Developer**
A junior developer is entering the IT field as a paid professional and they work with a team of other professionals.

Are you a junior developer?

If you've been a professional developer for less than a year (as a very general figure) then you're probably a junior.

Take a look at the next stage to see if it resonates. If not, then you might still be a junior who's transitioning into becoming an intermediate developer.

##### **Intermediate Developer**
An intermediate developer is a competent team member and contributor.

The telling sign I use for this stage is that intermediate developers usually have a mental urge or "pull" to believe that they know everything they need to know.

Perhaps they feel like their views on how to best architect a system are "complete."

Perhaps they feel like Javascript is the only programming language they ever need and ever want.

Whatever it is, there is some degree of feeling like they've "found" the silver bullet or that their current view is finally "the one."

The intermediate stage is like stepping into puberty for your career.

For example, teens tend to begin believing that they know better than their parents.

They tend to experiment and be bold about what they believe.

They begin to tread a path of their own.

This is the intermediate developer. They are starting to think for themselves.

##### **Senior Developer**
The senior developer is becoming very skilled and knowledgeable to the point that those around them are looking to them as a mentor and a "go-to".

They usually have some specialized or advanced programming knowledge and can build more complex systems using advanced techniques and patterns.

Seniors are confident in what they know due to their experiences. But they also have a grasp on the fact that there's so much they don't know about.

The biggest telling sign that you are in this stage is whether or not your peers are constantly coming to you for advice and guidance. Are you mentoring others too? These are all signs of being a senior developer.

##### **Lead Developer**
The lead developer is focused on providing high-level guidance to their dev team.

But more importantly, they are a bridge or connector between the development team and the other business-oriented departments in your organization.

Are you leading a team of developers? Do you also have to communicate with non-technical managers or other departments about what the development team is working on, etc? If so, you're a lead developer.

##### **Tech Leader**
I hesitate to include this one, but I think it's helpful to see where your career could go in the future.

A tech leader has made a name for themselves as an expert in some specific area(s) and usually have a very targeted branding/positioning as to what they do well.

That might be a specific programming language, web security, front-end development with react, a developer mentor, or even a particular industry.

They could be community builders who have a following of people that look up to them as a direct or indirect mentor.

They could be thought leaders who champion some specific cause or idea.

They usually speak publicly about their area of expertise or the ideas that they champion.

In a nutshell, they are technology experts and very skilled communicators.

If that sounds like you, then you might be a tech leader.

##### **Conclusion**
It takes a lot of work to grow in your career. But it's worth it.

Above all else, just keep pushing forward, stay humble, and keep learning!
