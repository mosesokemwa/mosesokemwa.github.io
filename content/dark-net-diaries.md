This has been you at a specific point in your life. The Expert Beginner is one who has new skills to learn in their craft and improvements to make in their professional life, and is intentional about how they grow.

A high number of Expert Beginners are found in the Tech industry because it is receptive to career transitions and tech employees are asked to be dynamic. Some people in tech have a tech related certification from university, others can rightfully brag to be self-taught while others were in a completely different industry - like I was before I became a Software Engineer.

The lack of experience is what makes someone a Beginner. Beginners are excited about new opportunities and are always eager to please, theyâ€™ll typically under/overestimate time from start to project completion, take on tasks that are way beyond their comprehension, and sometimes due to lack of experience in this new field they fear that their ideas or suggestion will be considered foolish.

The more chances one gets to put skills into good use and to learn from experiences, the more one can pick up from personal reflection and interactions with experienced team members and mentors.
On the other hand, instead of passively failing, the Expert Beginner is willing to learn from all the challenges and failures. The Expert Beginner stands out as an uncommon gem. Growth as an expert beginner is accelerated through experience coupled with time. The more chances one gets to put skills into good use and to learn from experiences, the more one can pick up from personal reflection and interactions with experienced team members and mentors.

Though there is no proven way to measure the time it takes to move from an Expert Beginner to an Advanced Beginner, one thing is for for sure: the more you practice and learn, the higher your chances are of getting there.
