I spent 5 hours of my night installing, reading docs, configuring, uninstalling and watching videos. All to understand how digital ocean and dockers cross paths. I must say, it was worth it. I came across things I knew and worked with before - Nginx, vagrant, and virtual machine. The only thing I heard to learn how to use with dockers was Nginx, the rest are things you use on the side.

Tall started with this tutorial, an interactive playground for all things docker. [http://training.play-with-docker.com/](http://training.play-with-docker.com/). Even the tone of the site is friendly to beginners.

Somehow I bumped into this channel on youtube -- [LearnCode.Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVTlvUkGslCV_h-nSAId8Sw). There is a 3 episode series on **Demystifying Docker** simplifying learning.

* [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGYAg7TMmp0)  -  Compares Docker to Vagrant and explain the differences. If you have worked with Vagrant before and you are a visual person, this will be easy to understand.
* [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBtWxj9l7zM)  -  The first miniature deployment with Docker. Done by creating a Digital Ocean machine with Docker installed and then running a Docker webserver container on the machine.
* [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6WER0oI-qs)  -  Looks into docker-machine, docker-compose (fig) and fun tooling.

By this point, I had installed [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/), [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) which comes with batteries installed and created a [Digital Ocean account](https://m.do.co/c/e6d5d61dec16) (got $10 free credit from a link in the part 3 video). I installed PostgreSQL twice because somehow I had forgotten how to work with it. Thanks to the documentation I was up and running in under 20 minutes.

Then came the best part of the night, watching the part 3 video from the above youtube channel then trying to work out what he said by referring to the docs.

**Update on progress.. 4:17 am**

Currently, I'm almost done with the getting started section on the docs. Doing this to familiarise myself with the docs, terminologies used and get the flow of how to work with Docker.
