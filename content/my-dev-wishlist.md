People keep on asking me what I want as gift, or what would I get a dev as a gift. Now I will have place to direct them to

#### Digital Ocean
Devs have side project that they are (always)working on, at times those projects grow big and need to be hosted for public use. I personally use <a href="https://digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> for my hosting needs. Unfortunaley they don't have gift vouchr one can use, thoguh you can set up a paypal account, load cash then gift the account to your nerd friend.

#### Netflix
I love watching incidan Movies, Anime TV shows and archeticture design(remodelling, gardening, remarkable building design.... ). A majority of these shows I can get them on <a href="netflix.com">Netflix</a>. Good thing is they have gift cards, disclaimer being you will need to go to <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/32950/">here</a> to find out if your country supports the buying of gift cards.

My current location(at the time of writing) shows me this.

```
"Netflix Gift Cards are not currently sold in your country. If you purchased a Netflix Gift Card in a different country, you will be able to use it as 
long as you pay for Netflix in the same currency as the gift card. Select the country you purchased the gift card from above for more information."
```

As with everythin there is a work around

- install a VPN(I use Windscribe)
- fire it up and pick a location(I use United Kingdom)
- follow this <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gift-cards">gift card store</a> link
- choose and option and well... buy the gift the card


#### Jetbrains Editor
Need I say more.. this is here because I use there tools, the intergration is convinient for me. I can't seem to find a way to buy a licence for a user, however you can do the same thing as with digital ocean. Find the store <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/store/#edition=personal">here</a>
You can get a license for the pack, mine includes cosists of GoLand and Pycharm

#### Wakatime
Tracking time spent writing code is importatn to me, first I get to see how much time is spent on code vs meetings. Second, I get bragging rights within my Wakatime time team when I consistently have the highest coding time.

This lsit is endless but I will add more with time
