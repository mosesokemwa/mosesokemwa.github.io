        <p>Moses Okemwa, this is your Personal Relative Strengths Report.
The Shortlist Relative Strengths report has been uniquely designed to uncover the ordering of 10 factors within you.
These 10 factors were chosen due to their strong association with the way you are effective at both work and in life.
What does &ldquo;relative strength&rdquo; actually mean?
Unlike &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; scores, &ldquo;relative&rdquo; scores cannot be compared to other individuals. They are used to identify factors that contribute the most to your personality and behaviour.</p>
<p>A high score on any factor means that it forms a dominant part of who you are.A low score simply means that, within you, other factors tend to be expressed in a more dominant fashion.
