<p>Due to certain figures in my life I decided earlier on that I would not go to campus, I could not deal with the idle time that they had. Go to any public uni and you will see free spirited souls roaming the corridors of their lecture halls. Laughter echoing in open spaces, libraries quit as people flip pages prepping for a cat. Things might have changed though I doubt its by that much.</p>
<p>Back to hard decisions, I knew campus life was not for me, I mean I have tried. Twice to be precise but I ended up stopping mid way, story for another day. I hate being idle, I&rsquo;d rather watch a movie than be there doing nothing(now that I say it out loud, I dont see any difference). With this in mind, I approach my parent and presented the rationale to her, the out come surprised me. I thought she would flip, but to my surprise she was cool with it, even funded two of my earlier start-up in agribusiness.</p>
<p>The path I chose might have been through premature rationale.. What does an 18/19 year old know about life to make such a decision like that. That&rsquo;s beside the point, after a string of 2 failed start-ups and 1 successful dope kick ass solo entrepreneurship stint, I decided to leave all that and move to different field.</p>
<p>From as far back as I can remember I have always loved fixing things. If it requires mental energy, and is challenging enough, I will find a way to put it back together or create a new one. I still I&rsquo;m the house handy man. I recently made a coffee table on a random evening. Home made coffee table, there is something funny about that. I should have taken the name Ralph after &lsquo;fix it Ralph&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So, with the pennies I pinched here and there, and a long hunt for an intense college program with no success, I joined a Software Development Bootcamp. I should mention that at this point there was no going back, literally nothing to go back to. I spent 4 months learning and countless nights awake, fear being my main motivation. Fuck, I was afraid of failing more than I was about getting my first job. I feared being the slacker in my class yet I knew deep down I was a smart fella, I still am.</p>
<p>After that phase I got hired by the same institution that taught me, I have been there for 4 moths as a student, and 3+ years as a staff member. The value I got from my first job was priceless, having a great boss helped. Though this being my first job as a techie, the pay was shit and surprisingly enough for me to survive and go parties and dates.</p>
<p>After helping the company grow by structuring the classroom experience and processes, I moved to the tech team. Using the same knowledge to systemise the main revenue driving processes using tech. Official title being Software Developer/Technical Team Lead. Might I add that I decided to give up a management track that was clearly before me in pursiut of a highly technical role. Still not that satisfied with the technicallities of my roles, but what I&rsquo;m doing will suffice.</p>
<p>Here I am, 27+yrs old, with amazing people skills, good management practices and great technical skills(imposter syndromes kicks in once in a while, clearly not when writing this), and always on the look for amazing experiences.</p>
<p>In my career as a Software Developer I would like</p>
