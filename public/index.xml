      <description>This has been you at a specific point in your life. The Expert Beginner is one who has new skills to learn in their craft and improvements to make in their professional life, and is intentional about how they grow.
A high number of Expert Beginners are found in the Tech industry because it is receptive to career transitions and tech employees are asked to be dynamic. Some people in tech have a tech related certification from university, others can rightfully brag to be self-taught while others were in a completely different industry - like I was before I became a Software Engineer.</description>

      <description>This is a process that I find myself doing over and over again, and for the most part I keep skipping a couple of steps or repeating them. Hopefully having it here will make my work easier the next time I need to set up NGINX.

      <description>When you log into an Ubuntu machine using SSH or a console, you’ll see a motd (“message of the day”) printed with some useful system information, as well as some useless marketing spam. The useless marketing spam is the same material you see when you visit motd.ubuntu.com. This is an affront to good taste, and should be disabled.
There are a few ways to disable the MOTD altogether. You can touch the file ~/.</description>

      <description>People keep on asking me what I want as gift, or what would I get a dev as a gift. Now I will have place to direct them to
Digital Ocean Devs have side project that they are (always)working on, at times those projects grow big and need hosting for public use. I use Digital Ocean for my hosting needs. Unfortunately they don&amp;rsquo;t have gift voucher one can use, though you can set up a PayPal account, load cash then gift the account to your nerd friend.</description>

      <title>Broken Image Handling With jQuery</title>

      <description>Missing images will either just display nothing, or display a [ ? ] style box when their source cannot be found. Instead, you may want to replace that with a &amp;ldquo;missing image&amp;rdquo; graphic that you are sure exists so there is better visual feedback that something is wrong. Or, you might want to hide it entirely. This is possible because images that a browser can&amp;rsquo;t find fire off an &amp;ldquo;error&amp;rdquo; JavaScript event we can watch for.</description>

      <description>So I decided to start sharing my brain with the world, and by doing that I needed a place where I can put all my thoughts together. Most of them are unstructured others sound really composed.
To be effective and not worry about the PR/Marketing side of things I decided to do things different.
