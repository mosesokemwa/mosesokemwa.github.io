These projects are divided in multiple categories, and each category has it’s own folder. To get started, simply fork this github repo.\nNumbers\nFind PI to the Nth Digit - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.\nFibonacci Sequence - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.\nPrime Factorization - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.\nNext Prime Number - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.\nFind Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor - Calculate the total cost of tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.\nMortgage Calculator - Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan.\nChange Return Program - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.\nBinary to Decimal and Back Converter - Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.\nCalculator - A simple calculator to do basic operators. Make it a scientific calculator for added complexity.\nUnit Converter (temp, currency, volume, mass and more) - Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to and then the value. The program will then make the conversion.\nAlarm Clock - A simple clock where it plays a sound after X number of minutes/seconds or at a particular time.\nDistance Between Two Cities - Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the cities like latitude and longitude.\nCredit Card Validator - Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum).\nTax Calculator - Asks the user to enter a cost and either a country or state tax. It then returns the tax plus the total cost with tax.\nFactorial Finder - The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, …1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion.\nComplex Number Algebra - Show addition, multiplication, negation, and inversion of complex numbers in separate functions. (Subtraction and division operations can be made with pairs of these operations.) Print the results for each operation tested.\nHappy Numbers - A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here. Find first 8 happy numbers.\nNumber Names - Show how to spell out a number in English. You can use a preexisting implementation or roll your own, but you should support inputs up to at least one million (or the maximum value of your language’s default bounded integer type, if that’s less). Optional: Support for inputs other than positive integers (like zero, negative integers, and floating-point numbers).\nCoin Flip Simulation - Write some code that simulates flipping a single coin however many times the user decides. The code should record the outcomes and count the number of tails and heads.\nClassic Algorithms\nCollatz Conjecture - Start with a number n \u003e 1.

If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.\nSorting - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort.\nClosest pair problem - The closest pair of points problem or closest pair problem is a problem of computational geometry: given n points in metric space, find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them.\nSieve of Eratosthenes - The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes (below 10 million or so).\nGraph\nGraph from links - Create a program that will create a graph or network from a series of links.\nEulerian Path - Create a program which will take as an input a graph and output either a Eulerian path or a Eulerian cycle, or state that it is not possible. A Eulerian Path starts at one node and traverses every edge of a graph through every node and finishes at another node. A Eulerian cycle is a eulerian Path that starts and finishes at the same node.\nConnected Graph - Create a program which takes a graph as an input and outputs whether every node is connected or not.\nDijkstra’s Algorithm - Create a program that finds the shortest path through a graph using its edges.\nData Structures\nInverted index - An Inverted Index is a data structure used to create full text search. Given a set of text files, implement a program to create an inverted index. Also create a user interface to do a search using that inverted index which returns a list of files that contain the query term / terms. The search index can be in memory. Text\nReverse a String - Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.\nPig Latin - Pig Latin is a game of alterations played on the English language game. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an ay is affixed (Ex.: “banana” would yield anana-bay). Read Wikipedia for more information on rules.\nCount Vowels - Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text. For added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found.\nCheck if Palindrome - Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”\nCount Words in a String - Counts the number of individual words in a string. For added complexity read these strings in from a text file and generate a summary.\nText Editor - Notepad style application that can open, edit, and save text documents. Optional: Add syntax highlighting and other features.\nRSS Feed Creator - Given a link to RSS/Atom Feed, get all posts and display them.\nQuote Tracker (market symbols etc) - A program which can go out and check the current value of stocks for a list of symbols entered by the user.

See if you can find out what periods of the day you use more and less and generate a report or graph that shows it.\nPort Scanner - Enter an IP address and a port range where the program will then attempt to find open ports on the given computer by connecting to each of them. On any successful connections mark the port as open.\nMail Checker (POP3 / IMAP) - The user enters various account information include web server and IP, protocol type (POP3 or IMAP) and the application will check for email at a given interval.\nCountry from IP Lookup - Enter an IP address and find the country that IP is registered in. Optional: Find the Ip automatically.\nWhois Search Tool - Enter an IP or host address and have it look it up through whois and return the results to you.\nSite Checker with Time Scheduling - An application that attempts to connect to a website or server every so many minutes or a given time and check if it is up. If it is down, it will notify you by email or by posting a notice on screen.\nClasses\nProduct Inventory Project - Create an application which manages an inventory of products. Create a product class which has a price, id, and quantity on hand. Then create an inventory class which keeps track of various products and can sum up the inventory value.\nAirline / Hotel Reservation System - Create a reservation system which books airline seats or hotel rooms. It charges various rates for particular sections of the plane or hotel. Example, first class is going to cost more than coach. Hotel rooms have penthouse suites which cost more. Keep track of when rooms will be available and can be scheduled.\nBank Account Manager - Create a class called Account which will be an abstract class for three other classes called CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount and BusinessAccount.

Each quiz can be different and then reads a key to grade the quizzes.\nSort Excel/CSV File Utility - Reads a file of records, sorts them, and then writes them back to the file. Allow the user to choose various sort style and sorting based on a particular field.\nCreate Zip File Maker - The user enters various files from different directories and the program zips them up into a zip file. Optional: Apply actual compression to the files. Start with Huffman Algorithm.\nPDF Generator - An application which can read in a text file, html file or some other file and generates a PDF file out of it. Great for a web based service where the user uploads the file and the program returns a PDF of the file. Optional: Deploy on GAE or Heroku if possible.\nMp3 Tagger - Modify and add ID3v1 tags to MP3 files. See if you can also add in the album art into the MP3 file’s header as well as other ID3v2 tags.\nCode Snippet Manager - Another utility program that allows coders to put in functions, classes or other tidbits to save for use later. Organized by the type of snippet or language the coder can quickly look up code. Optional: For extra practice try adding syntax highlighting based on the language.\nDatabases\nSQL Query Analyzer - A utility application which a user can enter a query and have it run against a local database and look for ways to make it more efficient.\nRemote SQL Tool - A utility that can execute queries on remote servers from your local computer across the Internet.

Generates a sales reports based on the order/order details tables or sums up the days current database activity.\nEvent Scheduler and Calendar - Make an application which allows the user to enter a date and time of an event, event notes and then schedule those events on a calendar. The user can then browse the calendar or search the calendar for specific events. Optional: Allow the application to create re-occurrence events that reoccur every day, week, month, year etc.\nBudget Tracker - Write an application that keeps track of a household’s budget. The user can add expenses, income, and recurring costs to find out how much they are saving or losing over a period of time. Optional: Allow the user to specify a date range and see the net flow of money in and out of the house budget for that time period.\nTV Show Tracker - Got a favorite show you don’t want to miss? Don’t have a PVR or want to be able to find the show to then PVR it later?

Add features you though are missing from your favorite music player.\nWatermarking Application - Have some pictures you want copyright protected? Add your own logo or text lightly across the background so that no one can simply steal your graphics off your site. Make a program that will add this watermark to the picture. Optional: Use threading to process multiple images simultaneously.\nTurtle Graphics - This is a common project where you create a floor of 20 x 20 squares. Using various commands you tell a turtle to draw a line on the floor. You have move forward, left or right, lift or drop pen etc. Do a search online for “Turtle Graphics” for more information. Optional: Allow the program to read in the list of commands from a file.\nSecurity\nCaesar cipher - Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts “HI” to “JK”, but key 20 encrypts “HI” to “BC”. This simple “monoalphabetic substitution cipher” provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.

<p><strong>A list of practical projects that anyone can solve in any programming language . These projects are divided in multiple categories, and each category has it&rsquo;s own folder.
To get started, simply fork this github repo.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Numbers</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Find PI to the Nth Digit - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fibonacci Sequence - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prime Factorization - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next Prime Number - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor - Calculate the total cost of tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mortgage Calculator - Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change Return Program - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Binary to Decimal and Back Converter - Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculator - A simple calculator to do basic operators. Make it a scientific calculator for added complexity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unit Converter (temp, currency, volume, mass and more) - Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to and then the value. The program will then make the conversion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alarm Clock - A simple clock where it plays a sound after X number of minutes/seconds or at a particular time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distance Between Two Cities - Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the cities like latitude and longitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credit Card Validator - Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax Calculator - Asks the user to enter a cost and either a country or state tax. It then returns the tax plus the total cost with tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Factorial Finder - The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, &hellip;1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complex Number Algebra - Show addition, multiplication, negation, and inversion of complex numbers in separate functions. (Subtraction and division operations can be made with pairs of these operations.) Print the results for each operation tested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happy Numbers - A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here. Find first 8 happy numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number Names - Show how to spell out a number in English. You can use a preexisting implementation or roll your own, but you should support inputs up to at least one million (or the maximum value of your language&rsquo;s default bounded integer type, if that&rsquo;s less).

</li>
<li>
<p>Sorting - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort.</p>
</li>
<li>
