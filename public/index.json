I am familiar with several languages and fluent in Python. All this experience comes from working on discreet, at times ambiguous challenges harnessing my ability to find unusual solutions to technical problems. The list of challenging work is rather long, ranging from Investment management products ro DevOps migration(Google Cloud/DigitalOcean to AWS). With this kind of experience, how do you go about putting it to good use? The answer is simple, find a role that matches your skills and experience. They are few and far between, but when you find one, it\u0026rsquo;s worth pursuing.\nI sent my application for the role of Senior Developer, and now we wait for the response. Fingers crossed!\nThe description of the role\nSenior Developer We\u0026#39;re seeking an experienced developer with a proven ability to find unusual solutions to technical problems. ABOUT THE ROLE Our senior developers work on ***** by turning product decisions into technical designs, and then into code. Alongside the existing senior developers, you\u0026#39;ll share responsibility for setting technical standards and designs. Our ******** are appliances (hardware and virtual) with a stack that starts with Linux kernel modifications and ends in CSS, touching network code, service daemons in Python and C, more DNS than you can imagine, Flask, and the HTML/JS/CSS combo along the way. The management consoles have their own stack, and bring different challenges in terms of scale. We have custom network protocols and more. A great candidate might not know each of these levels, but isn\u0026#39;t scared to learn. LOCATION Remote OR Hybrid KEY SKILLS We\u0026#39;re primarily looking for flexibility and ingenuity. A developer who isn\u0026#39;t too encumbered by strata. You\u0026#39;ll be able to point to examples of challenges you\u0026#39;ve tackled in unexpected ways. You\u0026#39;ll notice we don\u0026#39;t specify a language here, and that\u0026#39;s because the right candidate will be familiar with several languages, and fluent in at least one. Python experience is beneficial, but we\u0026#39;ve been making increasing forays into Go. Experience with code management, and development processes.

Make it a scientific calculator for added complexity.\nUnit Converter (temp, currency, volume, mass and more) - Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to and then the value. The program will then make the conversion.\nAlarm Clock - A simple clock where it plays a sound after X number of minutes/seconds or at a particular time.\nDistance Between Two Cities - Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the cities like latitude and longitude.\nCredit Card Validator - Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum).\nTax Calculator - Asks the user to enter a cost and either a country or state tax. It then returns the tax plus the total cost with tax.\nFactorial Finder - The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, \u0026hellip;1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion.\nComplex Number Algebra - Show addition, multiplication, negation, and inversion of complex numbers in separate functions. (Subtraction and division operations can be made with pairs of these operations.) Print the results for each operation tested.\nHappy Numbers - A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here. Find first 8 happy numbers.\nNumber Names - Show how to spell out a number in English. You can use a preexisting implementation or roll your own, but you should support inputs up to at least one million (or the maximum value of your language\u0026rsquo;s default bounded integer type, if that\u0026rsquo;s less).

Optional: Allow the program to read in the list of commands from a file.\nSecurity\nCaesar cipher - Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts \u0026ldquo;HI\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;JK\u0026rdquo;, but key 20 encrypts \u0026ldquo;HI\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;BC\u0026rdquo;. This simple \u0026ldquo;monoalphabetic substitution cipher\u0026rdquo; provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.

Any migration tool, including Alembic, can automatically generate a migration file for you that is immediately ready for use, with no modifications required.\nThe problem arises when you have a table that is populated with data. You specify that you want a new field that doesn’t accept null values, yet, you already have a host of rows on the table created prior to this new addition. These rows won’t have values for the new field so they would default to null.\nAlembic still generates a migration script but you will need to add some code of your own to successfully make the schema change. You want to add code to the migration script that sets a default value on the field as Alembic doesn’t handle this automatically.\nSay you wanted to add a new boolean field: is_admin.\nclass User(db.Model): # other fields is_admin = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False, nullable=False) Alembic would generate the migration script below\nfrom alembic import op import sqlalchemy as sa # revision identifiers, used by Alembic. revision = \u0026#39;635d30762810\u0026#39; down_revision = \u0026#39;ad4b629ace65\u0026#39; branch_labels = None depends_on = None def upgrade(): # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ### op.add_column( \u0026#39;users\u0026#39;, sa.Column(\u0026#39;is_admin\u0026#39;, sa.Boolean(), nullable=False) ) # ### end Alembic commands ### def downgrade(): # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ### op.drop_column(\u0026#39;users\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;is_admin\u0026#39;) # ### end Alembic commands ### If you try to apply this migration as is, you are going to get an error saying\nsqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (psycopg2.IntegrityError) column \u0026#34;is_admin\u0026#34; contains null values [SQL: \u0026#39;ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_admin BOOLEAN NOT NULL\u0026#39;] (Background on this error at: http://sqlalche.me/e/gkpj) This error is reporting that we have null values which the nullable=False constraint doesn’t permit. We can fix this by doing the following:\nAdd the new column: is_admin with nullable set to True Then update the value of the field on all existing rows to false Then update the column is_admin to be non-nullable Here is what the updated migration script looks like. The updated portions have been emphasized. from alembic import op import sqlalchemy as sa # revision identifiers, used by Alembic. revision = \u0026#39;635d30762810\u0026#39; down_revision = \u0026#39;ad4b629ace65\u0026#39; branch_labels = None depends_on = None def upgrade(): # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ### op.add_column( \u0026#39;users\u0026#39;, sa.Column(\u0026#39;is_admin\u0026#39;, sa.Boolean(), nullable=True) ) # updated part op.execute(\u0026#34;UPDATE users SET is_admin = false\u0026#34;) op.alter_column(\u0026#39;users\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;is_admin\u0026#39;, nullable=False) # ### end Alembic commands ### def downgrade(): # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ### op.drop_column(\u0026#39;users\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;is_admin\u0026#39;) # ### end Alembic commands ### We only need to make this change to the migration script, we do not need to make any changes to the User model.\nWhen you try applying the migrate command, you should see that the operation is executed successfully this time. You can verify that all existing users have the is_admin column set to false. At this point, you can update the column on selected rows to true.\nIn this piece, we assumed that the bulk of the users would be non-admin users.

Beginners are excited about new opportunities and are always eager to please, they’ll typically under/overestimate time from start to project completion, take on tasks that are way beyond their comprehension, and sometimes due to lack of experience in this new field they fear that their ideas or suggestion will be considered foolish.\nThe more chances one gets to put skills into good use and to learn from experiences, the more one can pick up from personal reflection and interactions with experienced team members and mentors. On the other hand, instead of passively failing, the Expert Beginner is willing to learn from all the challenges and failures. The Expert Beginner stands out as an uncommon gem. Growth as an expert beginner is accelerated through experience coupled with time. The more chances one gets to put skills into good use and to learn from experiences, the more one can pick up from personal reflection and interactions with experienced team members and mentors.\nThough there is no proven way to measure the time it takes to move from an Expert Beginner to an Advanced Beginner, one thing is for for sure: the more you practice and learn, the higher your chances are of getting there.\n","permalink":"https://mosesokemwa.github.io/blog/posts/dark-net-diaries/","summary":"This has been you at a specific point in your life.
